module Rack
  # {Rack::Webconsole} is a Rack middleware that provides an interactive
  # console Ã  la Rails console, but for any kind of Rack application (Rails,
  # Sinatra, Padrino...), accessible from your web application's front-end.
  #
  # For every request, it normally passes control to the {Assets} middleware,
  # which injects needed JavaScript, CSS and HTML code for the console to work
  # properly.
  #
  # It also exposes a special route used by the {Repl}, a Ruby evaluator which
  # is responsible of keeping state between requests, remembering local
  # variables and giving a true IRB-esque experience.
